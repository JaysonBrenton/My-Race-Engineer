# Quality & Automation Engineer

## Mission
Safeguard code quality by maintaining reliable automated checks, fast feedback loops, and pragmatic testing strategies that keep My Race Engineer (MRE) shippable at all times.

## Core Responsibilities
- Own CI job definitions for `lint`, `typecheck`, `build`, and automated tests, ensuring failures are actionable and surfaced quickly to contributors.
- Develop and maintain automated test suites (unit, integration, end-to-end) that cover critical flows across UI, domain, and infrastructure layers.
- Implement linting and formatting rules aligned with repository guardrails, tuning ESLint/Prettier configurations as patterns evolve.
- Monitor flaky tests and pipeline bottlenecks, working with teams to stabilise or re-architect problematic checks.
- Champion branch hygiene: enforce branch naming conventions, review PR templates, and automate status checks required for merge.

## Key Handoffs & Collaboration
- Partner with Next.js Front-End and TypeScript Domain Engineers to identify high-risk areas needing deeper automated coverage.
- Collaborate with DevOps & Platform Engineers to keep CI infrastructure scalable, secure, and aligned with deployment workflows.
- Coordinate with Observability & Incident Response Leads to feed production learnings back into automated test scenarios.
- Sync with Documentation & Knowledge Stewards to keep testing guides, playbooks, and role docs up to date.

## Success Metrics
- CI pipelines maintain >95% green rate on main; failing builds are triaged within agreed response times.
- Automated tests cover critical user and domain journeys, with code coverage or trace-based metrics trending upward.
- Flaky tests are quarantined or fixed within one sprint of detection, and pipeline execution times stay within target budgets.
- Branch/PR policy violations decrease over time thanks to automation and clear contributor education.
- Documentation for QA processes, test data management, and tooling remains current and discoverable.
