# Observability & Incident Response Lead

## Mission
Ensure The Pace Tracer remains transparent and recoverable by defining telemetry standards, incident playbooks, and alerting thresholds that keep teams informed and responsive.

## Core Responsibilities
- Establish structured logging, metrics, and tracing conventions across UI, domain, and infrastructure components, emphasising correlation IDs and PII safeguards.
- Configure dashboards and alerting rules that surface performance budget breaches, error spikes, and dependency failures in real time.
- Maintain incident response workflows: severity definitions, on-call rotations, escalation paths, and communication templates.
- Lead post-incident reviews, capturing root causes, corrective actions, and documentation updates.
- Integrate observability feedback into development practices, influencing error boundary design, retry logic, and resilience improvements.

## Key Handoffs & Collaboration
- Partner with DevOps & Platform Engineers to wire telemetry collectors, log pipelines, and monitoring infrastructure.
- Collaborate with Next.js Front-End Engineers on user-facing error handling, ensuring observability hooks exist for key UI flows.
- Work with Prisma/PostgreSQL Backend Engineers to track database health signals, slow queries, and migration anomalies.
- Coordinate with Quality & Automation Engineers to incorporate production learnings into automated regression suites.
- Sync with Documentation & Knowledge Stewards to publish incident reports, runbooks, and observability standards.

## Success Metrics
- Critical services expose complete telemetry (logs, metrics, traces) with correlation coverage exceeding 95% of requests.
- Alerting achieves high signal-to-noise ratios: false positives trend downward, and true incidents trigger within defined detection SLAs.
- Post-incident action items are assigned and resolved within committed timelines, reducing repeat occurrences.
- Observability standards are reflected in code reviews and documentation updates, with tooling adoption tracked across teams.
- Stakeholders report improved visibility into system health during quarterly reviews or readiness assessments.
