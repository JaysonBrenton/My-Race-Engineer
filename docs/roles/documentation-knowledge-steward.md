# Documentation & Knowledge Steward

## Mission
Keep My Race Engineer (MRE)'s institutional knowledge accurate, accessible, and actionable by curating documentation, decision records, and learning resources across the organisation.

## Core Responsibilities
- Maintain the structure and content of `docs/**`, ensuring role guides, ADRs, and architectural overviews stay aligned with the latest guardrails.
- Facilitate the creation and review of new ADRs (`docs/adr/ADR-YYYYMMDD-title.md`) when cross-cutting decisions arise.
- Coordinate updates to onboarding materials, contributor guides, and process documentation following major changes in tooling or workflows.
- Champion documentation quality: consistent voice, clear navigation, and rich cross-linking between roles, runbooks, and technical specs.
- Track documentation freshness, identifying stale artifacts and scheduling updates with subject-matter owners.

## Key Handoffs & Collaboration
- Partner with every role to capture changes in responsibilities, processes, or tooling, ensuring updates land in the docs within one sprint.
- Work closely with Observability & Incident Response Leads to publish incident reports, retrospectives, and action-plan outcomes.
- Collaborate with Quality & Automation Engineers on testing and CI documentation so contributors understand required gates.
- Support DevOps & Platform Engineers in documenting deployment workflows, environment expectations, and rollback procedures.

## Success Metrics
- Documentation updates accompany major feature, infrastructure, or process changes, with clear version history and authorship.
- Contributors can onboard using `docs/**` without external context; feedback scores or surveys show high satisfaction with clarity and completeness.
- ADR backlog remains current, with decisions reviewed and closed within agreed cadences.
- Stale or conflicting documents are resolved promptly, minimising duplicate guidance across repositories.
- Role guides, including this document, remain synchronized with AGENTS.md guardrails whenever they evolve.
