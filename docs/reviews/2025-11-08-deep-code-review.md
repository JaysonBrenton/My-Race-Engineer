# Deep code review — 2025-11-08

## Scope
- Registration server action (`src/app/(auth)/auth/register/actions.impl.ts`) and supporting login page messaging.
- `RegisterUserService` application logic plus Prisma adapters involved in user, session, and verification-token persistence.
- Related unit and integration tests covering the registration flow and login session issuance.

## Highlights
- Registration persistence now executes inside a dedicated Prisma-backed unit of work so user creation, session minting, and verification token writes succeed or fail atomically. A duplicate email racing the insert surfaces a deterministic `{ ok: false, reason: 'email-taken' }` instead of bubbling a Prisma error.【F:src/core/infra/prisma/prismaRegistrationUnitOfWork.ts†L1-L21】【F:src/core/app/services/auth/registerUser.ts†L61-L177】
- Session secrets are hashed (SHA-256) before storage. Both the domain types and Prisma repositories expose only the digested value, closing the plaintext exposure identified in the prior review.【F:src/core/app/services/auth/registerUser.ts†L44-L160】【F:src/core/infra/prisma/prismaUserSessionRepository.ts†L1-L38】
- The server action and login page can communicate a combined `verify-email` + `awaiting approval` outcome (`status=verify-email-awaiting-approval`), preventing users from being left in limbo without guidance.【F:src/app/(auth)/auth/register/actions.impl.ts†L404-L443】【F:src/app/(auth)/auth/login/page.tsx†L90-L120】
- Registration tests now exercise duplicate-insert races, email-dispatch failures, and the combined verification/approval branch. The form-submission integration test locks in the new redirect semantics.【F:tests/core/auth/registerUserService.test.ts†L214-L260】【F:tests/app/auth/form-submission.test.ts†L360-L441】

## Remaining risks / follow-ups
- Existing `UserSession` rows still contain unhashed tokens. Schedule a one-off migration to hash current entries (or revoke and rotate) before deploying this change to production.【F:prisma/schema.prisma†L121-L139】【F:src/core/app/services/auth/registerUser.ts†L144-L159】
- The registration cleanup path swallows Prisma errors after logging. If cleanup repeatedly fails we should add an operational alert so pending users do not accumulate silently.【F:src/core/app/services/auth/registerUser.ts†L254-L272】
- Consider extending metrics/telemetry to capture the new `verify-email-awaiting-approval` outcome so product analytics can distinguish between plain verification waits and approval bottlenecks.【F:src/app/(auth)/auth/register/actions.impl.ts†L404-L443】
