# UX Principles

My Race Engineer (MRE) pursues a calm, high-contrast aesthetic that keeps telemetry data and supporting workflows easy to scan on any device. This document captures the first set of applied principles for the authentication experience so we can build new screens without deviating from the design language or accessibility guardrails.

## Foundations

- **Typography:** Use the global Inter font stack declared in `layout.tsx`. Heading levels should follow semantic order and never skip levels for visual effect.
- **Colour tokens:** Only reference semantic CSS variables from `globals.css` or approved Tailwind aliases (`bg-surface`, `text-fg`, etc.). Avoid literal hex values inside components.
- **Spacing scale:** Operate on `0.25rem` increments. Primary container padding should land on `1.5rem`, `2rem`, or `2.5rem` depending on viewport width.
- **Focus & motion:** Focus outlines must use the accent token and maintain `outline-offset: 3px` minimum. Motion is limited to subtle transforms (<4px translate) and opacity fades that respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- **Error language:** Lead with the action users need to take. Example: “Check your email for a verification code” instead of “Verification email sent”.

## Authentication surfaces

### Shared layout

- Render all authentication flows within a centred card that maxes at **420 px** and stretches to 100 % width on small screens.
- Surface a concise heading (`<h1>`) and a supporting paragraph that explains the task on the page. Keep supporting copy ≤ 110 characters.
- Provide at least `1.5rem` spacing between the descriptive header and the form controls to prevent crowding.
- The background card must use `var(--color-surface)` with a 1 px `var(--color-border)` outline and `var(--shadow-elevated)` for depth.

### Form structure & tokens

- Include a hidden `formToken` input generated by `generateAuthFormToken(context)` for every auth form (`login`, `registration`, `password-reset`). Do not surface the token value in the DOM outside the hidden control.
- Inputs use `var(--color-surface-overlay)` backgrounds, `var(--color-border)` outlines, rounded corners (`0.75rem`), and padding (`0.75rem 1rem`).
- Primary buttons use `var(--color-accent)` backgrounds with `var(--color-bg)` text, full-width layout, and 9999px pill radii. Hover states should elevate subtly (`translateY(-1px)` and `box-shadow: var(--shadow-elevated-strong)`).
- Destructive buttons mirror the primary button shape/animation, but use `var(--color-danger)` backgrounds with `var(--color-danger-contrast)` text and focus outlines that stay on the danger token.
- Secondary navigation links stay inline, use the accent colour, and include underline on hover for clarity.

### Accessibility commitments

- Every control must have an explicit `<label>` connected via `htmlFor`/`id`. Supplementary guidance (e.g., password rules) should live in `<p>` or `<ul>` elements referenced by `aria-describedby`.
- Provide an `aria-live="polite"` status region within each form so submission feedback (errors, confirmations) can be announced to assistive tech. The region should reserve space even when empty.
- Checkbox controls should use the native `accent-color` token to keep focus rings visible and meet contrast requirements.
- Use valid `autocomplete` attributes (`email`, `current-password`, `new-password`, `one-time-code`) to simplify keyboard and assistive tech flows.
- Ensure link groups or alternate actions stay reachable via keyboard and provide focus outlines consistent with buttons.

### Microcopy guidelines

- Lead with the benefit: “Access telemetry dashboards” instead of “Log in”.
- Password requirement lists should be terse (max five bullets) and framed as positive statements (e.g., “Contains at least one number”).
- Confirmation language should describe the next step (“We’ll send reset instructions to your inbox within a minute.”).
- Avoid jargon such as “MFA” unless accompanied by an explanation or tooltip.

## Implementation checklist

Use this checklist during code review or manual QA for any authentication surface:

- [ ] Page title and meta description reference the specific auth action.
- [ ] Hidden `formToken` field present with a context-specific value.
- [ ] `aria-live` region exists, is referenced by relevant inputs, and has `aria-atomic="true"`.
- [ ] Links to sibling auth flows (`/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/reset-password`) are present where appropriate.
- [ ] Form controls respect the spacing scale and token palette above.

## Follow-ups

- Add stateful validation messages once the authentication API is plumbed in.
- Document the visual theme tokens in `docs/design-principles.md` once that file graduates from placeholder status.
- Pair this guide with Storybook examples after the initial auth surfaces settle.
