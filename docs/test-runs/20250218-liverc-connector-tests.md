# 2025-02-18 — LiveRC connector test sweep

## Context
- **Initiator:** Automated test execution request
- **Scope:** All unit-level LiveRC connector suites in `tests/core/liverc/` plus the LiveRC connector smoke test in `tests/connectors/liverc/`.

## Execution steps
1. Installed workspace dependencies via `npm install`.
2. Ran the combined suite with:
   ```bash
   npx tsx --test tests/core/liverc/*.test.ts tests/connectors/liverc/*.test.ts
   ```

## Outcome
- **Pass:** 17
- **Skip:** 1 (`LiveRC homepage responds with HTML` — requires `LIVERC_E2E=1`)
- **Fail:** 0
- **Duration:** ~19s wall-clock

## Notes
- Initial attempt failed because the workspace dependencies had not yet been installed (`node-html-parser` missing). Installing via `npm install` resolved the issue and the rerun passed.
